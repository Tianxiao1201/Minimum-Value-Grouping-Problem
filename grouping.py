# Algorithm Description and Time Complexity Analysis

# Algorithm Description:
# The algorithm solves the Minimum-Value Grouping Problem using dynamic programming. 
# Given a sequence of n positive integers, it finds the optimal way to partition the sequence into k groups 
# to minimize the sum of the cubes of the sums of the numbers in each group.
# The dynamic programming state dp[i][j] represents the minimum objective function value for partitioning the 
# first i elements into j groups. To find the optimal solution, we consider every possible last group formed by 
# elements x to i, where x is in the range [j-1, i], and find the one that minimizes the objective function.
# The algorithm uses a bottom-up approach to fill in the values of the dp table, iterating over the number of 
# elements and the number of groups to compute the values based on previous computations.

# Time Complexity Analysis:
# The algorithm consists of:
# 1. Calculating prefix sums, which takes O(n) time.
# 2. Initializing DP and cut position tables, which takes O(nk) time.
# 3. Filling the DP table, which takes O(n^2k) time due to the three nested loops.
# 4. Retrieving the cut positions, which takes O(k) time.
# Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2k).

# Note: Since we are given that k â‰¤ n, in the worst case where k is close to n, the complexity remains bounded by O(n^3), 
# which is a polynomial-time complexity relative to the input size. However, the algorithm may not be efficient for large values 
# of n and k due to the cubic factor.



# This function calculates the minimum value of grouping the input sequence into k groups, 
# such that the sum of the cube of each group's sum is minimized. It uses a dynamic programming approach.
